  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    By downloading or using the app, you agree to these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before using the application.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You may not attempt to extract the source code of the app, translate it into other languages, or create derivative versions. All intellectual property rights related to the app remain with GhostContact.
  </p>

  <p>
    GhostContact is committed to ensuring the app is as useful and efficient as possible. We reserve the right to update or change the app and its services at any time. We will always inform you clearly if any charges are introduced.
  </p>

  <p>
    The GhostContact app does not collect personally identifiable data from users. However, to improve the app and fix errors, we may process anonymized crash or error data through third-party services (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics).
  </p>

  <p>
    It is your responsibility to keep your device and access to the app secure. We recommend against jailbreaking or rooting your device, as it may compromise your security and affect app functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    GhostContact is not responsible for issues arising from lack of internet connectivity. Some features of the app require an active internet connection. If you're using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider’s data charges may apply.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are responsible for any charges incurred while using the app. If you are not the bill payer of the device, we assume you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app.
  </p>

  <p>
    GhostContact cannot be held responsible if your device runs out of battery or experiences issues that prevent the app from functioning.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we strive to provide up-to-date and accurate content, GhostContact cannot accept liability for any direct or indirect loss resulting from reliance on the app’s content, especially when dependent on third-party services or data.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may occasionally update the app. System requirements may change, and you may need to download updates to continue using the app. We do not guarantee continuous compatibility with all OS versions.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may also terminate the app or your access to it without prior notice. Upon termination, your rights to use the app will cease, and you must delete the app from your device if requested.
  </p>

    We may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically.

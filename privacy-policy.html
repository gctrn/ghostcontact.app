    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the
      collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with our app.
      By using our service, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect any personally identifiable information from users. Our
      app does not require you to submit your name, email address, or any other
      personal data to function.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for the purpose of improving the app and identifying issues, we
      may collect anonymous crash reports and diagnostic data through
      third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>Crash Reporting and Log Data</h2>
    <p>
      In the event of an application error or crash, we collect diagnostic data
      via <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>, a service provided by Google.
      This may include information such as device type, operating system
      version, time of the crash, and general usage data. These data are
      anonymous and are used solely to improve app performance and stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      This application does not use cookies directly. However, some third-party
      libraries or services integrated within the app may use cookies to improve
      their functionality. You may choose to accept or refuse these cookies
      through your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
      We may engage third-party companies or individuals for the following
      purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To facilitate our service</li>
      <li>To provide the service on our behalf</li>
      <li>To perform service-related tasks</li>
      <li>To assist us in analyzing app performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These third parties have access to anonymous data strictly for the
      purpose of performing the tasks assigned to them. They are contractually
      obligated not to disclose or misuse the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Crash and diagnostic data collected via Firebase Crashlytics is retained
      only as long as necessary to analyze and resolve technical issues. No
      personal data is stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We value your trust and strive to protect the data collected through
      commercially acceptable means. However, no method of transmission over the
      Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee
      absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      Our app may contain links to third-party websites. If you click on a
      third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Please note that
      these external websites are not operated by us. We strongly recommend
      reviewing the Privacy Policy of these websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under
      the age of 16. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their
      children's use of mobile applications and to instruct them not to share
      personal data without permission. If you believe a child has provided us
      with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate
      action.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Although we do not collect personal data, if you are located in a
      jurisdiction such as the European Union (GDPR) or Turkey (KVKK), you may
      have certain rights regarding data access, deletion, or objection. You can
      contact us if you have any concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with a new effective date. You are advised to review
      this policy periodically for updates.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Effective date: 2025-04-10</strong></p>
